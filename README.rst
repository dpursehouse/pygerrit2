Pygerrit2 provides a simple interface for clients to interact with
`Gerrit Code Review`_ via the REST API.

Prerequisites
-------------

Pygerrit2 is compatible with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.  Support for Python 3
is experimental.

Pygerrit2 depends on the `requests`_ library.


Installation
------------

To install pygerrit2, simply::

    $ pip install pygerrit2


Usage
-----

This simple example shows how to get the user's open changes. Authentication
to Gerrit is done via HTTP Basic authentication, using an explicitly given
username and password::

    >>> from pygerrit2.rest.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
    >>> from pygerrit2.rest import GerritRestAPI
    >>> auth = HTTPBasicAuth('username', 'password')
    >>> rest = GerritRestAPI(url='http://review.example.net', auth=auth)
    >>> changes = rest.get("/changes/?q=owner:self%20status:open")

Note that is is not necessary to add the ``/a/`` prefix on the endpoint
URLs. This is automatically added when the API is instantiated with an
authentication object.

If the user's HTTP username and password are defined in the ``.netrc``
file::

    machine review.example.net login MyUsername password MyPassword

then it is possible to authenticate with those credentials::

    >>> from pygerrit2.rest import GerritRestAPI
    >>> from pygerrit2.rest.auth import HTTPBasicAuthFromNetrc
    >>> url = 'http://review.example.net'
    >>> auth = HTTPBasicAuthFromNetrc(url=url)
    >>> rest = GerritRestAPI(url=url, auth=auth)
    >>> changes = rest.get("/changes/?q=owner:self%20status:open")

Note that the HTTP password is not the same as the SSH password. For
instructions on how to obtain the HTTP password, refer to Gerrit's
`HTTP upload settings`_ documentation.

Also note that in Gerrit version 2.14, support for HTTP Digest authentication
was removed and only HTTP Basic authentication is supported. When using
pygerrit2 against an earlier Gerrit version, it may be necessary to replace
the `HTTPBasic...` classes with the corresponding `HTTPDigest...` versions.

Refer to the `example`_ script for a full working example.
